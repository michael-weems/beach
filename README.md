# Beach

Tool to assist in taking files off my field recorder. Archive / delete recordings I don't want, tools for editing the files: trimming, cutting, filtering frequencies, etc...

## Why would you use this?

If you have a ton of raw audio files you want to quickly ingest, do some light processing on, and later (possibly with a different tool) shove into an organized library.

## Why Sokol

Not because it's necessarily the right tool for the job, but because I want to learn it more for other projects.
